# JSwingRPG
RPG game with a JSwing gui. Create items, explore and fight .

This is my first Java program, before I was taught alot of basic programming principles and design I just jumped head first and wrote
code without thought or planning but attacked the learning curve slope with self learning tools.


# How To RUN
